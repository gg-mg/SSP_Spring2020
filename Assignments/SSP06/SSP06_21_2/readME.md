# login.php

is the application file that does what was intended in SSP05.php

I found out how to access the database on 3/21/2020, two weeks after i submitted the assignment to 
FileZilla submission forum (OCCC).

It is importtant to note 

action "." refers to index.php

action "" refers to current page

action "#" refers to current page 

## login success

after running login.php, the application echos the login email and the password which indicates 
that the visit to the database was successful.
